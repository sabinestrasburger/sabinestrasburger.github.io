During my last semester at Kapi'olani Community College, I took Math 140 which was Trignometry and Analytic Geometry. I had an excellent professor who didn't teach math in a typical manner. At the end of the semester, he assigned a final project where we were to use what we learned about trigonometry and apply it to a "real world" problem.

I chose to show how you would get the formula for trail, which is the area where the front wheel of a bike touches the ground to where (if you'd draw a straight line down from) the steering access to the ground. Calculating trail is a important factor in understanding the handling capabilities of a bike. This formula can be used for either bicycles or motorcycles. You can read more about trail [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_and_motorcycle_geometry#Trail).
