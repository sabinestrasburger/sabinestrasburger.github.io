We were always taught to not be shy in class and to raise our hands if we're confused about something or need help. "There's no such thing as a stupid question," my teacher would say. According to Eric Raymond, there is. In his article <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#code">How to Ask Questions The Smart Way</a>, Raymond bluntly talks about people he considers are "losers." These losers he defines as those "who seem unwilling to think or do their own homework before asking questions." At first, I took the tone of the article as unnecessarily hostile. So what if someone posts a question that he would consider stupid? It doesn't even matter. Only that for hackers like him it does matter since as he stated, most of the people who answer these questions posted to forums take precious time out of their day to help people solve their problems. Considering this, I can see how after receiving dumb questions day after day would get frustrating.

As a "newbie" myself, I appreciate this essay. Since I began the Computer Science program, I've been a frequent user of Stack Overflow and sites of the like. Whenever I had a question about an error in my code or how to approach a problem, I would search and find a number of hits from people who posted questions on the same type of problem. Sometimes, I would see posts from people that would word their question the exact way that I would, but their post would have many downvotes. I couldn't understand why, since I would generally find the answer to the question down below in the comments anyway, so it's not like it was a bad question right? Wrong. Take <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29832688/how-to-alphabetize-a-list-on-c?noredirect=1&lq=1">this</a> post for example. One of the first things Raymond states to do in his essay if before you ask a question, try to find an answer. In this person's post they say "I have looked everywhere and I am having a hard time," yet in the comment right below, someone says that they easily found an answer by searching a few keywords. They also aren't very concise with their code and fail to explain what is going on in it or what errors they have come across.

Meanwhile, questions like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array">this one</a> are a great example of an excellent question. The code is concise to the areas where there are suspected issues and the question-er explicitly states what his code is doing and what he has tried on his own to solve the issues with it. By doing this, he shows that he's not "a lazy sponge and wasting people's time."

People who post in these technical forums expect a high quality, accurate and professional answer to their questions. But it's a two way street. In order for the answer to be of such quality, it's only right that the question be too. Raymond's essay provides excellent guidelines for anyone seeking to get the effective help they desire.
