## Java as a Second Language

It was exactly one year ago from today when I wrote my first program. It consisted of a few simple lines of code that printed the words "Hello, World!" to my computer's screen. It seemed like magic that by pressing some keys on a keyboard and clicking a button you could make this piece of metal and circuits do almost anything you wanted. That was my first experience with Java and since then up until now, I've had plenty of practice with the language in ICS 111 and 211.

For me, Java was a humbug language to learn as a first programming language. The structure that Java uses for Object-Oriented programming was a huge leap for me conceptually. It took me a while to grasp how to create objects from separate "cookie-cutter" classes, but once I finally got the hang of it, it was a rewarding experience using Java to create little applet games. Even without any language to compare Java to, I could tell it's a really nitpicky language when it comes to syntax. Although I've come to appreciate this as I've begun to delve into other languages such as Javascript.

## A Quick Introduction

Coming into ICS 314, I had no idea what to expect from this class. I was surprised at the structure of the class after the first day since we were assigned homework and was expected to write code in a different programming language in at least the first month or so. This is unrealistic, I thought since it took me months to be able to write code in Java at the level of code in Javascript expected in this class in the first few weeks. But after the FreeCodeCamp assignment where we were introduced to the syntax of Javascript, I can see this isn't an unrealistic expectation at all because of the similarities to Java. As long as one is already comfortable with the syntax and structure of Java, Javascript is a piece of cake.

My first impression of Javascript is that it feels like Java, but if Java took off its training wheels. At first glance, the syntax looks deceivingly similar. But taking a closer look, Javascript is visibly much more simplistic and less by the book than Java.

I learned the hard way during the first official WOD that one major difference between Java and Javascript is there are no explicitly defined types in Javascript. I had typed in "int" and set it equal to i in my for loop, which was one of the problems that my program wouldn't successfully run. Instead, there is no need for variables to stay strictly ints or doubles which is something I'm fond of so far. Javascript is also much more lax when it comes to data storage. In Java, if we wanted to create a list or array of items, they all had to be the same type. No mixture of strings and ints in the same array. While trying to solve problems for class, this often caused issues and I would have to find a way to work around this by implementing multiple arrays for different types of items. This led to more complex looking code.

Javascript is a kind language that doesn't even require you to construct a class to create objects. Those objects can be created and assigned "keys" that can also hold values - any type of value you want. I absolutely love this and can see how much easier and enjoybale Javascript makes coding.
  
## Under Pressure

As for the WODs, at first I shriveled up when I heard that we would have to solve a coding problem under pressure. Doing anything under pressure is a big no-no for me, because my first instinct is to panic. Even after all these years of schooling, I still freak out a little during every test I take. However on second thought, I see this as a great learning experience to help me get over this issue and after the first WOD, I already feel a teensy bit better. I notice more and more classes I take share this sort of half-half learning environment where the students are expected to spend time outside of class learning and reviewing the material, then come to class prepared to do exercises on the topic learned. I thought this was pretty "junk" but then I realized that I'm forced to come prepared to do exercises and spend lots of time outside of class studying. There's no room for slacking off. This, I realized is an effective class format where as long as the student follows the layout, he/she is set up for success.
