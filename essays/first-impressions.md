The only language I've been exposed to thus far is Java. I was introduced to it in ICS 111 and learned how to use it in an interactive way by creating simple games. It was a great first experience, but also a stressful one. I quickly learned that Java was a very particular language. It was at most times very frustrating to learn. Now that I've started learning a bit of Javascript in this class, I can really see how uptight Java is in comparison. So far, I really like Javascript and enjoy coding in it since it feels a bit more lax in a way, although I can definetly see the similarities that Javascript shares with Java.
  
As for the WODs, at first I shriveled up when I heard that we would have to solve a coding problem under pressure. Doing anything under pressure is a big no-no for me, because my first instinct is to panic. Even after all these years of schooling, I still panic a little during every test I take. However on second thought, I see this as a great learning experience to help me get over this issue and after today's WOD I already feel a teensy bit better. I notice more and more classes I take share this sort of half-half learning environment where the students are expected to spend time outside of class learning and reviewing the material, then come to class prepared to do exercises on the topic learned. I thought this was pretty "junk" but then I realized that I'm forced to come prepared to do exercises and spend lots of time outside of class studying. There's no room for slacking off. This, I realized is an ingenious class format where as long as the student follows the layout, he/she is set up for success.
