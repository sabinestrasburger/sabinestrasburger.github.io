## In Retrospect

Growing up, I've always favored more of the artistic classes in school rather than science classes. In high school I flourished in English and Ceramics and other subjects of the like that depended on creativity. On the other hand, I detested Math, Chemistry, Anatomy, and Physics. It wasn't because I studied hard and couldn't grasp the material. In fact, I hardly ever put my mind to those subjects in high school yet I still somehow got B's and C's. I think the root of my distate for science stemmed from me thinking that I was never a "science-y person" and that I could never be the sharp, analytical person that many STEM students tend to be. Looking back, I wish I could've told high school me that it was normal to think those thoughts, but that they weren't true.

## Second Chances

My interest in science and math started to pick up when I enrolled in an accelerated math program at Kapi'olani Community College. I dreaded the idea of taking three math courses and a research course in one semester, but it was the only way that I could get ahead in my math requirements since I placed near the bottom of the math food chain when I came into KCC. Each class was about 6 weeks long so I knew had no room to slack off and I needed to push myself to make sure I got help when I needed it. Luckily, the professors I had were excellent in making sure everyone had a full grasp on the material, and the program assigned lab hours each day to do homework which gave us ample time to get the help we needed. As corny as it sounds, this program provided me with not only a good foundation in mathematics, but the confidence to pursue a STEM degree.

## Testing the Waters

I knew I wanted to pursue a degree in the sciences but was never a biology or chemistry type of person. Being a Filipina, I tried giving the medical field a shot and enrolled in an introductory course in Zoology at KCC (the course name was Zoology but what we actually studied was human anatomy and physiology. Strange, I know). I knew after just scraping by in that class that going any further into any sort of medical degree would be a mistake. I went back to the drawing board and talked to a few counselors about my interests. I wanted to be in a field that would challenge me to think in different ways and since I'm a generally indecisive person, I also wanted to be able to apply the skills I acquire in college to anything I want to pursue in my post-academic career. Computer Science is a true melting pot of innovativeness, creativity, and technology. It's a field that encourages collaboration as well as individual success. Not to mention, computers and techonology will never be obsolete. After completing the first introductory class in the Computer Science program at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, I became addicted to the rewarding feeling of solving complex and challenging problems and knew that this was the right path for me.

My lack of background in computer science related endeavours dettered me for at first. Most people who enter this field of study already seem to know how to program or have a specific interest. Although I know I eventually have to choose a specialization, I'm enjoying being immersed in a variety of topics that the Computer Science program at UH Mānoa provides. In this class I hope to gain more exposure to software engineering technologies and learning new programming languages. I saw a number of these technologies listed on the course website including the Intellij Idea integrated development environment, the Semantic UI user interface framework, and the Meteor web application framework. I've never been exposed to most of the topics this class covers, so I'm looking forward to learning more about them and being one more step further from being a computer science novice. It's only been a few weeks since the semester started and I've already been introduced to a Javascript so I'm eager to see just how much I can absorb from this class by May.
