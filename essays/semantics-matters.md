The last couple weeks was the most exciting time I've had since learning to make simple arcade-style computer games come to life using Eclipse. Even before deciding to major in computer science, I've often looked at html language from afar and admired it for its ubiquitousness in our technology-based society. In recent years I've noticed that there are more companies like <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> that offer to build your own personalized simplistic website. This is a great tool for anyone who doesn't want to spend a great amount of time learning a markup language like html in addition to figuring out how to format everything on a webpage to their liking. After the last couple of weeks, I can empathize with those people. However I think there is a certain feeling of accomplishment in building a website from scratch, similar to how an artist feels with their finished masterpiece.

## HTML Fledgling

In the previous week, we were tasked with creating the most basic of webpages. Being as I've never created a webpage or even wrote in html before, I was eager to complete the WOD and see the finished product. Before this class, whenever I would run into a webpage written in raw HTML and CSS, I would click the back button immediately. I thought it looked very old fashioned and the kind of site that perhaps didn't have the most credible of sources (some of the time.) After the Browser History WODs, I've come to appreciate the effort that goes in even the simplest of webpages. By the end of <a href="http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s18/morea/ui-basics/experience-browserhistory3.html">BrowserHistory3</a>, I felt giddy at seeing how an uncomplicated webpage could, little by little, be tailored to the creator's liking. 

## It's Just Semanticsâ€¦ UI
It's a common idea in our society that appearances matter. You wouldn't wear "slippahs" and board shorts to a job interview (unless you're applying to be a lifeguard I suppose.) The same idea can be applied to webpages. Webpages made with only raw HTML look less put together and outdated. For any sort of purposeful website, if you want to project a professional, modern, appealing, and trustworthy impression onto the user viewing it, then the basics just don't cut it. That's where <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a> comes in.

After the challenging process of completing the Browser History Wods (for me at least), I thought that to be able to create a more modern looking site would take countless hours for an HTML novice like me. I had clicked ahead at the coming week's WOD and saw that our next task was to create another webpage but tenfold better than A History of Browsers. I thought to myself, "how can we jump from creating the most basic of websites one week to a high quality one like <a href="https://islandsnow.com/">Island Snow</a> the next?" I was disheartened at the fast pace of this week until I attempted the <a href="http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s18/morea/ui-frameworks/experience-islandsnow-semantic.html">Island Snow WOD</a> and saw how easy it was to use Semantic to create an amazing looking webapge in the same amount of time it took me to create a mediocre one in raw HTML.

Some might view Semantic as a shortcut or even a "cheat" way to create beautiful looking websites. I instead view it as a medium for those of us who want to personalize our sites in our own way without using complete generic templates, but who also  aren't exactly fluent in HTML.
