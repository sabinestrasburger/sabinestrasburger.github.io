I never knew about the struggles of coding until my first few assignments, then project in ICS 111. Just starting out writing code and not knowing anything about Java, I felt I was at risk for falling behind in the class because there was no way I was going to memeorize all the syntax of the Java language in a semester's time.

## 

I had initially taken ICS 111 at Kapi'olani Community College to test the waters on Computer Science. In retrospect, that was a good move on my part because that class was more slow-paced and geared towards students who had little to no experience in coding. The only complaint I had about that class was the development environment my professor required for that class - jGRASP. jGRASP is described as a "lightweight development environment created specifically to provide automatic generation of software visualizations to improve the comprehensibility of software." At the time, jGRASP seemed so advanced and hard to work with, but having more experience with other, better development environments, I can see how primitive jGRASP really is. It had an early 2000s Windows feel about it and didn't have any sort of editor that would show an error in the code as you were typing. The only way your would know if there was something amok in your code is when you run it and the console would tell you there was an error. It was very infuriating and made assignments take a lot longer to do than it should have.

I barely got by in that class and I wholeheartedly believe it was because of jGRASP. Maybe my professor thought that using the most basic environment would somehow be an advantage for us in the long run. But for newbies to coding, it was a massive disadvantage as I was less inclined to want to attempt my homework knowing the amount of hours I'd potentially have to put in trying to debug my errors instead of actually solving the homework problem.

## Second Time's the Charm

When I transferred to Manoa and registered for ICS 111 again, I felt that if I got through a whole semester using jGRASP for the first time and barely got by, I could do it again and ace the class. Then we were introduced to Eclipse and I was discouraged because I would have to start from square one with a new development environment and I'd fall behind. Or so I thought. To my delight, Eclipse was much easier to use and didn't look like it came straight out of Windows 2000. The greatest benefit of Eclipse was that if I had a syntax error, a red mark would appear on the line of code where the error occured. Better yet, Eclipse would give me a hint as to what the syntax error was, saving me a huge amount of time from the dark times when I was limited to jGRASP.
