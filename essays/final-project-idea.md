## Overview

The problem: The average UH student spends hundreds of dollars each semester on books they'll only need for a few months. 

The solution: Book Barter allows UH students to save more of their money and opt to trade in books for credits that can be exchanged for other students unwanted textbooks.

## Approach

Once a profile is created, the user can get an estimate for their textbook of how many credits they'll receive when trading in their used books. They can submit a picture of the book along with proof of purchase, ISBN, and other information regarding the book.

Some mockup pages include:

<ul>
<li>Landing page</li>
<li>Seller home page</li>
<li>Admin home page</li>
<li>Seller profile page.</li>
</ul>

## Use case ideas

<ul>
<li>New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. (How do they learn how system works?)</li>
</ul>
